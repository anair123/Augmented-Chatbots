    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p class="conclusion">To conclude, the LSTM and GPT-2 models show promise with regards to generating personalized text. The GPT-2 model created sentences that, on surface level, matched the text that it was trained with in terms of fluency and cohesion. However, in terms of quantifiable metrics, it returned mixed results. The sentence length of the generated text matched that of the original for only 16 out of the 30 celebrities. Furthermore, the sentiment and subjectivity scores of the generated text came close to that of the original for only 15 and 10 celebrities, respectively. With such results, it is difficult to currently build and execute a personalized chatbot. For future reference, this experiment should be rerun at a much larger scale. This entails collecting an exorbitant amount of text data, training text generation models with different architectures and parameters, and evaluating them with the help of a third party. Constructing a model with the ability to personalize text will expand the realm of possibilities of businesses that seek to incorporate AI into their business model to streamline their processes. Accomplishing this feat can signify a big milestone in the current rise of artificial intelligence. </p>
