    <h1>Problem Statement</h1>

    <p class="problem_statement">This project explores the idea of personalizing bots through the use of natural language generation. Instead of relying on a bot that contains a limited set of text responses, having a bot that can project a “personality” can grant users a more satisfying experience. This begs the question: Can a bot, trained with a specific body of text, generate its own text with a writing structure and personality that resembles the original text? This project aims to answer this by taking text from famous celebrities and generating text that is similar to the content and structure of the corresponding celebrities. Attempting to build a creative chatbot that can write its own words and sentences will give more insight into how realistic the prospect of a personalized chatbot is and what obstacles must be overcome to realize this technology.
